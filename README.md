# OneMap-to-Rqtl-4waycross
Interactive script and tutorial for converting a OneMap map and genotype file into R/qtl format for a 4-way cross

The OneMap tutorial for Outcrossing Populations should be completed before this tutorial to generate the necessary files. 

This repository includes the R script (.rmd) file, the three necessary input files (phenotype, map and genotype file generated from OneMap), a PDF of the script with detailed instructions & example output, and an example of the .csv output file.

Please reach out with any questions, comments, or suggestions (amccarty@umces.edu).
